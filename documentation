nstallation Steps
1. Clone or Download the Code
If the code is hosted on a repository, you can clone it using Git. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from Git Downloads.

To clone the repository, use this command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/palindrome-checker.git
Alternatively, if the code is a single file, you can simply download the palindrome_checker.py file.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository (or downloading the file), navigate to the folder containing the script:

bash
Copy code
cd palindrome-checker
3. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. If desired, you can create and activate one:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
If the script does not have any external dependencies, you can skip this step.

Running the Palindrome Checker
Once you've set up the project, you can run the Palindrome Checker script.

1. Run the Python Script
Execute the script by running:

bash
Copy code
python palindrome_checker.py
